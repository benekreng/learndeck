        "front": "What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?",
        "back": "A shallow copy duplicates as little as possible, typically only the top-level object and the immediate values. A deep copy duplicates everything it can, including objects referenced by fields. Shallow copy is faster but can lead to issues with shared references, whereas deep copy is safer but more memory-intensive.",

        "front": "Describe the use of the volatile keyword in C.",
        "back": "The volatile keyword is used in C to tell the compiler that the value of the variable may change at any time without any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby. This is often used in multi-threaded applications and with hardware that modifies its state independently from the running program.",

      //   "front": "What is tail recursion? Provide an example.",
      //   "back": "Tail recursion is a recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. It allows for optimization by compilers into iteration, which prevents stack overflow. Example: Calculating factorial in a tail-recursive manner involves an accumulator parameter to carry the factorial value.",

      //   "back": "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a programming idiom used in C++ to manage resource allocation and deallocation. RAII ensures that resources such as memory, file handles, and network connections are properly cleaned up when the owning object is destroyed, thus helping to prevent resource leaks and undefined behavior.",

      //   "front": "Explain the difference between overriding and overloading in object-oriented programming.",
      //   "back": "Overriding is when a derived class implements a method of its base class that has the same signature, changing its behavior. Overloading is when two or more methods in the same scope have the same name but different parameters, allowing methods to be called based on the argument types.",

      //   "back": "Generics enable algorithms and classes to operate on generic types, allowing for code reuse across disparate data types. This leads to stronger type checks at compile time, elimination of casts, and the ability to implement generic algorithms. It simplifies the code and can lead to performance improvements.",
