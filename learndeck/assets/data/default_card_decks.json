A deep copy duplicates everything it can, including objects referenced by fields. Shallow copy is faster but can lead to issues with shared references, whereas deep copy is safer but more memory-intensive.",

This is often used in multi-threaded applications and with hardware that modifies its state independently from the running program.",
